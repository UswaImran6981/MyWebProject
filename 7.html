            <p>If you want to avoid future pitfalls look for a commitment to quality manufacturing. An expert
                fabricator ensures precision measurements and consistent dimensions throughout all ductwork pipes.
                Close attention must be paid to the individual design specifications that clients may have. Quality
                assurance means checking and double-checking the joints, ensuring that the ducts are resistant to
                corrosion, and that heat and weather conditions wonâ€™t compromise the structural integrity of the
                system.</p>
            <p>Ductwork installation typically includes working on installing the ducts for these heating,
                ventilation and air conditioning systems but can also include waste extraction systems, vacuum
                systems and dust & fume extraction systems.</p>
