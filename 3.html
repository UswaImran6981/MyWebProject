            <p>SMAW (Shielded Metal Arc Welding), also called stick welding is the most commonly used welding
                approach in all arc welding procedures. To join various metals, it utilizes an electric current and
                an anode at the weld pool.
                <br>
                Its versatility and simplicity makes it more popular. The anode consists of a stick or solid metal
                stick (therefore the name) encircled by a covering of metal powders and composites with an agent
                that binds them so that they can fasten to its surface.

                Remember that the correct term for the rod is an electrode. The electric current (AC or DC) is used
                to produce an electric arc between the metals youâ€™re attaching and the electrode. This spot is known
                as the weld pool
