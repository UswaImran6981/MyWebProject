            <p>Pipe fabrication is the process of welding piping components such as pipes, elbows, tees, flanges,
                etc., into engineered piping systems in exact accordance with our customers' design requirements. We
                have facilities strategically placed around the world that use state-of-the-art technologies and
                processes.</p>
            <p>The pipe fabrication process requires to assemble pipes and pipe fittings according to the spool
                drawing. Pipe fabricators must take into consideration the size of the assembly, as transportation
                could be a problem. In such cases, Sub-assemblies are an effective way of transporting large
                projects. Piping fabrication is done as per the below-mentioned steps:
