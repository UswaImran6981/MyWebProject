        <main>
            <p>Welding is a process used in a number of industries, and there are several different processes
                welders can use depending on what kind of project theyâ€™re working on.
                <br>
                If you like working with your hands and are detail-oriented, you might consider a career in the
                field. Universal Technical Institute (UTI) teaches four major types of arc welding processes,
                including gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), which both use shielding
                gases to help protect welds from contaminants.
                <br>
                Pure argon or an argon mix is often the choice when it comes to the shielding gases used for these
                methods. Keep reading to find out more about how argon works.
