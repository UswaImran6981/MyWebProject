        <main>
            <p>Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter
                into a workpiece. This may be done by varying direction[2] on one or several axes, cutter head
                speed, and pressure.[3] Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on
                scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations. It is one of the
                most commonly used processes for machining custom parts to precise tolerances.
                <br>
                Milling can be done with a wide range of machine tools. The original class of machine tools for
                milling was the milling machine (often called a mill). After the advent of computer numerical
                control (CNC) in the 1960s, milling machines evolved into machining centers: milling machines
                augmented by automatic tool changers, tool magazines or carousels, CNC capability, coolant systems,
                and enclosures. Milling centers are generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) or
                horizontal machining centers (HMCs).
